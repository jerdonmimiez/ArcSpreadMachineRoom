  <title>PigIR Web Page Processing Facilities</title>

<body>
Provides tools for processing Web pages in both Hadoop, and Java
application contexts.

Provides tools for processing Web pages, such as:
<ul>
  <li>Part-of-speech tagging (for Pig/Hadoop and Java applications).</li>
  <li>Stopword management (<code>Class Stopwords</code>. (for
         Pig/Hadoop and Java applications).</li> 
  <li>Extraction of link anchor test, and image tag <code>ALT</code>
      and </code>Title</code> attribute values. (for Pig/Hadoop and
      Java applications).</li> 
  <li>Iteration over Web pages in WebBase crawls (for Pig/Hadoop and
      Java applications).</li> 
  <li>Word count (for Pig/Hadoop context only).</li>
  <li>Indexing Web crawls (for Pig/Hadoop context only).</li>
  <li>Word pair distance analysis (for Pig/Hadoop context only).</li>
  <li>HTML stripping (for Pig/Hadoop context only).</li>
  <li>TF/IDF computation over crawls (for Pig/Hadoop context only).</li>
</ul>
Some of this functionality is available only for use with Pig in a
Hadoop context. Others are available in Hadoop as well as from regular
Java applications. These latter capabilities are part-of-speech
tagging, stopword management, extraction of link anchor tags and img
tag attributes, and iteration over WebBase crawls.
</p>
For examples and the top entry points for the Java application
accessible facilities, consult the following:
<ul>
  <li>For stopword management, see the {@link
      edu.stanford.pigir.arcspread.Stopwords
      Stopwords main() method}.</li>
  <li>For anchor text extraction, see the {@link
      edu.stanford.pigir.arcspread.AnchorAltTitleExtractor
      AnchorAltTitleExtractor main() method}.</li>
  <li>For pulling crawl pages from WebBase, see the {@link
      edu.stanford.pigir.arcspread.WebBasePagePulling
      WebBasePagePulling main() method}.</li>
  <li>For parts-of-speech-tagging, see the {@link
      edu.stanford.pigir.arcspread.POSTagger
      POSTagger main() method}.</li>
</ul>
</p>
For the Pig/Hadoop facilities, please see the Bash scripts
under <code>/src/main/pigScripts/CommandLineUtils</code> in the source
tree. These scripts start the Pig jobs; the Java UDF classes are in
that same directory tree.
