To perform clustering, first run the cluster prep script in PigIR.
That will create a To_Cluster directory in a directory you specify with text 
files to be clustered.  Pass this directory (the directory in which To_Cluster 
resides) to the cluster script along with a number of topics.  If you want to 
re-cluster the same set of pages, but with a different number of topics, run 
the Re-Cluster script.
NOTE the HADOOP_HOME environment variable must be set in order for this script to run correctly.
